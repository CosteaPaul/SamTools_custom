NA18507_part.fa contains two sequences cut from the human genome
build36. They were exatracted with command:

  samtools faidx human_b36.fa 2:2043966-2045540 20:67967-69550

Sequence names were changed manually for simplicity. ex1.fa.fai is the
index for the sequence file, generated by:

  samtools faidx ex1.fa

This index file also works as the reference list file used by `import'
and `pileup' commands of samtools. ex1.sam.gz contains MAQ alignments
exatracted with:

  (samtools view NA18507_maq.bam 2:2044001-2045500;
   samtools view NA18507_maq.bam 20:68001-69500)

and processed with an awk command to make everything consistent as a
standalone alignment.

To try samtools, you may run the following commands:

  samtools import ex1.fa.fai ex1.sam.gz ex1.bam
  samtools index ex1.bam
  samtools tview ex1.bam ex1.fa
  samtools pileup -cf ex1.fa ex1.bam
  samtools pileup -cf ex1.fa -t ex1.fa.fai ex1.sam.gz
