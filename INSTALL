Compiling samtools requires the zlib library <http://www.zlib.net/>;
compiling the alignment viewer further requires the GNU ncurses library
<http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/>.

Please type `./configure; make' to compile samtools. If it fails, try
`make -f Makefile.generic'. If the compilation still fails due to errors
in RAZF or the lack of ncurses, try `make -f Makefile.lite' to disable
the alignment viewer and the RAZF-enhanced FASTA indexer.
