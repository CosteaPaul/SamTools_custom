Compiling samtools requires the zlib library <http://www.zlib.net/>;
compiling the alignment viewer further requires the GNU ncurses library
<http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/>. The default Makefile builds the
alignment viewer. If compilation fails due to errors in RAZF or the lack
of ncurses, you can compile with `make -f Makefile.lite'. However, the
alignment viewer will not be available; the FASTA indexer will not
support indexing compressed FASTA, either.
