System Requirements
===================

Most of SAMtools functionality only depends on zlib which is included in
this source code package. Compiling the alignment viewer further
requires the GNU ncurses library <http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/>,
which comes with Mac OS X and most of the modern Linux/Unix
distributions. If you do not have this library installed, you can still
compile the rest of SAMtools by manually modifying two lines in Makefile
as is described in the Makefile.


Compilation
===========

Type `make' to compile samtools.


Installation
============

Simply copy `samtools' and other executables/scripts in `misc' to a
location you want (e.g. a directory in your $PATH). No further
configurations are required.
